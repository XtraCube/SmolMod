An Among Us Mod that makes the map and pets bigger!
Support for players without the mod coming soon

## Installation
1. Download the `.zip` from releases that matches your game version.
2. Copy the `.zip` file into your Among Us folder, which can be found by going to your Steam Library, right clicking Among Us, hovering over Manage, then clicking `Browse local files`.

3. Extract the `.zip` file so your Among Us directory looks like this:

4. Start Among Us! If the Mod worked, you should see some text saying "Bepinex" and "Reactor" and stuff.
